The goal of this program is to simulate a province from the game.
To do so, it will need some data from the user, data wich will be asked through the console.
By doing so, it can :
	- give the output of the province
	- give the food balance of a province
	
It allows the user to play around with some variables to modify the output of a province.
They can either directly add modifiers to output and food or 
use program handled modifiers like buildings, techs or pops.

To start the program, launch Province_helper.py
